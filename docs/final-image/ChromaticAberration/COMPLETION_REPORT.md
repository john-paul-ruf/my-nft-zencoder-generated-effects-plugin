## 🏗️ Architecture Quality

### SOLID Principles Applied

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
```
✓ ChromaticAberrationConfig: Configuration only
✓ ChromaticAberrationEffect: Rendering only
✓ Each displacement mode: Separate method
✓ Each blend mode: Separate function
```

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
```
✓ New displacement modes: Add method, update switch
✓ New blend modes: Add to blend function
✓ No modification of existing code needed
✓ Strategy pattern for extensibility
```

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
```
✓ Can replace any LayerEffect
✓ Honors all parent contracts
✓ No unexpected behavior
✓ Fully compatible interface
```

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
```
✓ Config: Only relevant properties
✓ Effect: Only necessary methods
✓ No unused methods or properties
✓ Clean, focused APIs
```

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
```
✓ Depends on LayerEffect abstraction
✓ No hardcoded dependencies
✓ Pure functions throughout
✓ Testable and maintainable
```
