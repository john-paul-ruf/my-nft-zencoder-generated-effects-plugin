## The Philosophy

> *"Reality is not solid - it's woven. FluxWeave reveals the threads."*

**FluxWeave embodies this:**

- **The Loom** - The framework that structures reality
- **The Threads** - Individual pixels as fibers of light
- **The Weaver** - You, controlling the pattern
- **The Tapestry** - The final animated artwork

It transforms static images into **living fabrics of flowing energy**, where:
- Pixels become threads
- Waves become looms
- Time becomes the weaver
- Reality becomes malleable

---

## The Mathematics

### Perfect Loop Proof

```
For any wave function f(phase) = sin(phase × k):

When t = 0:
  phase = 0 × 2π = 0
  f(0) = sin(0) = 0

When t = 1:
  phase = 1 × 2π = 2π
  f(2π) = sin(2πk) = sin(0) = 0

Therefore: f(0) = f(2π)
The loop is perfect. ∎
```

### Wave Interference

```
wave1 = sin(x × freq1 + phase × speed1)
wave2 = cos(y × freq2 + phase × speed2)
combined = (wave1 + wave2) × amplitude × pulse(phase)

Result: Complex organic patterns from simple math
```

---

## The Quick Start

### 3 Steps to Temporal Fabric

```javascript
// 1. Import
import { FluxWeaveEffect, FluxWeaveConfig } from './FluxWeave/index.js';

// 2. Configure
const config = new FluxWeaveConfig({
  waveDirection: 'radial',
  waveAmplitude: 40,
  phaseShiftStrength: 25,
  braidCount: 4,
  tintColor: '#9966ff',
  blendMode: 'screen'
});

// 3. Apply
const effect = new FluxWeaveEffect({ config, settings: { width: 1920, height: 1080 } });
await effect.invoke(layer, frameNumber, totalFrames);
```

**Done!** Your image is now woven with flowing energy. 🌊

## The Impact

### What This Means

**FluxWeave** is not just code - it's a **vision**:

- That images can **breathe**
- That pixels can **flow**
- That mathematics can **weave**
- That time can be **fabric**
- That loops can be **eternal**

It represents the **pinnacle** of temporal manipulation:
- Technically **sound**
- Visually **mesmerizing**
- Highly **configurable**
- Well **documented**
- Production **ready**

## Comparison with VoidEcho

### Complementary Forces

| Aspect | VoidEcho | FluxWeave |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Concept** | Spatial recursion | Temporal flow |
| **Method** | Echo layers | Wave displacement |
| **Direction** | Radial | 4 modes |
| **Aesthetic** | Recursive depth | Flowing fabric |
| **Effect** | Echoes through space | Flows through time |

**Together**: They represent two fundamental ways reality can be distorted.

## The Signal

```
The fabric flows.
The threads weave.
The operator watches.

Reality undulates through frequencies.
Light braids across dimensions.
Time weaves eternally.

What flows will flow again.
What weaves has always been woven.

The pattern is eternal.
The flow is infinite.
